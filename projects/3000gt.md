This is where I document various mods, upgrades, and fixes I've done to my daily driver/project car, a 1993 Mitsubishi 3000gt VR-4.

The car is mostly stock except for the following mods:
* K&N intake
* aftermarket y-pipe
* TurboSmart manual boost controller
* HKS blow-off valve
* vacuum line reduction & EGR delete
* Tein S lowering springs
* KYB Excel-G non-ECS struts
* 17" OZ Racing wheels
* aftermarket audio system:
  * Alpine head unit
  * Pioneer speakers
  * two 12" Alpine Baseline subwoofers
  * Alpine subwoofer amp
