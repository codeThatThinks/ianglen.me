## Version 2.5

The frame has been redesigned to increase its ability to withstand a crash and to reduce weight. The entire power system has been replaced with higher quality components, so the flight times have improved significantly.

### Specs

* Frame: Custom 350mm; 16mm carbon fiber tubes, 1.5mm carbon fiber plate, 3D printed mounts
* PDB: Custom 120 A with power switch, current sensor, and filtered VTX power
* Motors: Tiger Motor MT2208-18 1100kv
* ESCs: Hobbyking Blueseries 30A running BLHeli
* Props: APC Multirotor 8x4.5
* Battery: Lumenier 3300mAh 4S 35C Lipo
* Flight Controller: Naze32 Full running Cleanflight
* Reciever: OrangeRX R617XL 6ch 2.4GHz
* OSD: Micro MinimOSD w/ KV Team Mod
* FPV Camera: FatShark 700TVL CMOS
* FPV Transmitter: FatShark 5.8GHz 250mW w/ ImmersionRC LHCP SpiroNet antenna

## Version 2

This is an in-progress build of a 350-size H quad. It's designed to be more durable and reliable. I'm reusing a few components from the first version so that I can recover a little bit of money from it.

### Specs

**Note: This setup does work, however the version above is significantly better.**

* Frame: Custom 350mm; 25mm carbon fiber tubes, 1.5mm carbon fiber plate
* Motors: Turnigy Aerodrive D2830-11 1000kv
* ESCs: Turnigy Multistar 30A w/ SBEC
* Props: APC Multirotor 9x4.5
* Battery: Zippy Flightmax 3000mAh 4S 20C Lipo
* Flight Controller: Naze32 Full running Cleanflight
* Receiver: OrangeRX R615x 6ch 2.4GHz
* Telemetry: cheap clone of 3DR Telemetry Module 915mHz
* FPV Camera: FatShark 700TVL CMOS
* FPV Transmitter: FatShark 5.8GHz 250mW w/ ImmersionRC LHCP SpiroNet antenna

## Version 1

The first version of my quadcopter was a 400-size X quad. It was constructed under a very tight budget, and while it flew, it was not durable and did not perform well. It suffered a hard crash and the frame completely disintegrated.

### Specs

**Note: Please do not build a quadcopter using this spec list. It doesn't fly well.**

* Frame: Custom 400-size; Made from plastic and fiberglass
* Motors: Turnigy Aerodrive D2830-11 1000kv
* ESCs: Turnigy Multistar 30A w/ SBEC
* Props: cheap clone of APC Electric 8x4
* Battery: Zippy Compact 4000mAh 3S 25C LiPo
* Flight Controller: Custom running Multiwii; Arduino Pro Mini; GY-80 IMU
* Receiver: Turnigy 9X8C v2 8ch 2.4GHz
* Telemetry: cheap clone of 3DR Telemetry Module 915mHz
