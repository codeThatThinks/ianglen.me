[Permanent - Will Smidlein's Blog](http://blog.willsmidlein.com/permanent/):

> The problem with the internet is that nothing is temporary. There’s always a cache, a backup, a screenshot, a file. And teens use the internet. And when people use the internet, they don’t always think before they act. This is true for blog comments, hurtful Facebook posts, threatening emails, etc.

This is extremely, extremely accurate.

This is why I didn't join Twitter until mid-2011. The permanence of the Internet always scared me. It was the reason I never joined Twitter or Facebook earlier. While I knew these services existed, I afraid to use them, as it might have a negative affect on me in the future. In recent times, I've become less and less paranoid, and eventually, after meeting Will Smidlein, I joined Twitter, and, in the case of Facebook, after much persuading, I joined Facebook.

I feel like writing a few paragraphs on how common sense prevents any issue related to this from ever happening, but I won't. Common sense is not common.

> Please, think before you post, especially if you’re a teenager. You don’t want one dumb mistake to ruin the rest of your life, or worse yet, someone else’s life.
