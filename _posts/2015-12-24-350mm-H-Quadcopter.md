A 350mm H-style quadcopter that I designed to be more durable and reliable. Some of the components I reused from the X-quad, but on a lot of things, like the carbon fiber frame, I started fresh.

In early 2017, I made some revisions to the design. The frame was redesigned to increase its ability to withstand a crash and to reduce weight. The entire power system was replaced with higher quality components, so the flight times have improved significantly.

Everything related to this build can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/codeThatThinks/Quadcopter), including drawings and schematics.
