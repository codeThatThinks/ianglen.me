It's been six months since I revived this blog from the scum of the interwebs. I haven't once regretted it.

This serves as a place to write down my thoughts, instruct others, solve problems, explain myself, and has a bunch of other uses I've forgotten about. For those of you that choose to read this pseudo-random stream of garbage, I thank you very much.

In no other project that I've started have I been able to maintain it as well as this blog. I don't know how much you'd care about that, but to me it is truly amazing.

Since school has ended a few days ago, I hope to further improve the quality and number of posts you'll find here. I've also got quite a bit of interesting projects and events coming up, so expect some interesting point of views.

Again I thank all of my readers, however numerous they may be, I hope that you guys keep on reading.

Side note: How does everyone feel about a separate Twitter account just for these blog posts?
