We successfully made it to three Rallycross events this year after a significant amount of preparations and modifications since purchasing the car in April. It performed great and there were no major incidents -- however we did manage to lose a bumper and exhaust pipe during one event.

With new shocks, springs, miscellaneous suspension components, and disconnecting the rear sway bar, we were able to get the balance of the car figured out. The Blizzak tires leave a little bit to be desired on wet grass and mud, but on the hard pack dirt of Joe's Speedway, the car had excellent grip and was able to put down some fast times.
