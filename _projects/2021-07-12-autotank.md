A robotic tank designed to carry heavy objects across a wide variety of terrain, both indoor and outdoor. May eventually become autonomous.

This project has been through three major revisions since its inception in 2018. It can carry a payload of up to 200 lbs and now features dual 1kW brushless motors, custom 3D printed tracks, Spektrum DSMX remote control, a large capacity 12S LiPo battery pack, CANBus, LED lights, wireless telemetry via Bluetooth, and a removable lid with accessory rails.
